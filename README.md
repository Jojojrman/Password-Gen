# Password-Gen
Password Generation
This Password generator asks the user for specific criteria for the password:
------------------------------
* Special characters ex, !@#$;
* Numbers ex, 1234;
* Caps ex ABCD;
If the user chooses one it'll get added to the main charset.
------------------------------
Confirms are used to see what special char is needed for the password.
length is prompted after the confirms to ask the user how long the password needs to be from 8-128 characters.
------------------------------
# For potential debugging
* console.log is added for the confirms as well as the charset;
* These are in the inspect chrome dev tools, under console;
* For the confirms it will show True or False;
* For the charset it will show the characters used in the password;
All will be in the console
